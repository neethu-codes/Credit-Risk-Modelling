# Credit-Risk-Modelling

A machine learning-powered **credit risk modeling application** that predicts an individual's **default probability**, computes a standardized **credit score (300â€“900)**, and assigns a **credit rating** based on financial and demographic data.

Built using `scikit-learn` for modeling and `Streamlit` for the interactive frontend, this app helps financial institutions assess creditworthiness with speed and transparency.


##  Project Overview

The application uses a trained **logistic regression model** to predict the likelihood of credit default. Based on this probability, a credit score is calculated and categorized into qualitative ratings such as *Poor*, *Average*, *Good*, and *Excellent*. The UI allows users to enter data like age, income, loan amount, credit utilization, and more to receive real-time scoring.


##  Features

-  Real-time prediction of **default probability**
-  Calculation of standardized **credit score (300â€“900 scale)**
-  Assignment of **credit rating** (Poor/Average/Good/Excellent)
-  Clean, intuitive **Streamlit UI**
-  Dynamic computation of derived metrics like **Loan-to-Income Ratio**

##  Dataset Information  

This dataset contains **50,000 loan applicants' records**, including demographic details, financial status, loan details, and credit history. The data is structured with **33 columns**, providing insights into factors influencing credit risk assessment.  

#### **Key Features:**  
- **Customer Information:** `cust_id`, `age`, `gender`, `marital_status`, `employment_status`, `income`, `number_of_dependants`  
- **Residence & Location:** `residence_type`, `years_at_current_address`, `city`, `state`, `zipcode`  
- **Loan Details:** `loan_id`, `loan_purpose`, `loan_type`, `sanction_amount`, `loan_amount`, `processing_fee`, `gst`, `net_disbursement`, `loan_tenure_months`, `principal_outstanding`  
- **Financial Status:** `bank_balance_at_application`, `number_of_open_accounts`, `number_of_closed_accounts`, `credit_utilization_ratio`, `enquiry_count`  
- **Repayment History:** `disbursal_date`, `installment_start_dt`, `total_loan_months`, `delinquent_months`, `total_dpd`  

ðŸ”¹ **Target Variable:** `default` (boolean) indicates whether a customer defaulted on the loan.  

This dataset is useful for building **credit risk models**, loan approval systems, and financial analytics applications.
